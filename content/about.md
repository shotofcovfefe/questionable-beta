Welcome, weary traveller, to my little corner of the interwebs. 

Whilst I can't offer you tea or kinship, I invite you to entertain my sketchy musings and sketchier writing at your own leisure. 

__Questionable Beta__ is a blog about climbing and other such stuff, maintained by an enthusiastic but ultimately pedestrian boulderer based in London, England.

Onwards, upwards, etc.
