Weary traveller, whilst I can't offer you tea or scones, I invite you to entertain my sketchy musings and sketchier writing at your own leisure. 

__Questionable Beta__ is a blog about climbing and other such stuff, maintained by an enthusiastic but ultimately mediocre boulderer based in London, England.

Onwards, upwards, etc.
