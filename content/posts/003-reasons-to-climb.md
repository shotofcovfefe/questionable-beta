Clickbait titles for fun, profit, and SEO supremecy. 

Anyway, reasons why I climb:

1. ~~To get abs~~
2. ~~To get a girlfriend~~
3. To momentarily liberate myself from the tedious pressures of the daily grind whilst simlutaneously quashing my episodic day dreaming of cutting loose from the modern world and starting a commune with allies and comrades up North in the Peak District. Also gym dogs.
