I havenâ€™t climbed in over a week. 

ðŸ‘‰ Dramatic pause. ðŸ‘‰ Audience cue to gasp. 

I know. It's not dramatic and I shouldn't complain. I snapped my finger in half earlier this year and was AWOL for some three months. That was dramatic. This is pittance. 

But Iâ€™m itching to get back on the wall. 

The skin on my fingers has grown back in spades and boy oh boy are the callouses *thicc*. Spare time's been hard to come by what with my starting a new gig and all. The last week has been a blur of meeting people, presentations, presenting, shipping (literally, first day production patch and deployment), sightseeing, and graciously sacrificing my diet in the name of a USA trip. 

All that to say, climbing has been on my mind but off my radar. 

The only real touchpoint has been trying on new climbing shoes in a few different REI's and Sports Basement's that happenstance have been close to the office or misc touristing.

This shouldn't be a priority right now. But I desparately need to replace my battered and bruised, circa 2019, entry level Scarpa's (the [Force V](https://us.scarpa.com/force-v)). Theyâ€™ve served me well â€” heck, theyâ€™ve held up well â€” but their best years are in the rearview.

And not just practically speaking. Theyâ€™ve recently become a manifest attack on my nostrils (ie, they f*cking reek), despite best efforts to the contrary. 

Having tried on a boat load of potential climbing shoes in the past week, I finally landed some that are hit the sweet spot on almost every dimension. That is: aggression, material, friction, volume, closure, sole. The shoes in question are the [Butora Gomi's](https://butorausa.com/products/gomi-1). I sampled shoes from other brands like La Sportiva, Scarpa, evolv, Black Diamond, etc. but none quite felt right in the same way. 

However. For all the boxes they tick, theyâ€™re ruinously seeped â€” drenched even â€” in an almost offensively garish Barbie-style shade of pink. This isn't a bad thing *per se*, pink is a colour I rock constantly. The problem is the fluorescence; I'll stand out like Elle Woods at Harvard in these suckers. 

Anyway. I slept on it. I read some reviews \[[1](https://gearjunkie.com/climbing/butora-gomi-climbing-shoe-review)\], \[[2](https://www.outdoorgearlab.com/reviews/climbing/climbing-shoes-womens/butora-gomi-wide-womens)\]. I slept on it. I tried them on and tested them again. I slept on it. 

And then I bought them. ðŸŽ‰

I'd like to think only \_part\_ of the purchase can be explained because I received my first pay cheque in several months today. Honestly, I couldn't think of a more apt way to celebrate than leaning into being a jolly old capitalist. 

Side note: the gent's version, cut slightly wider but less form fitting to my feet, is a gorgeous pastel sky blue. As much as I want to bend physics to get them to fit well to my feet, it ain't gonna happen. 

Super excited to set them free from their cage and onto the wall.
