I havenâ€™t climbed in over a week. 

ðŸ‘‰ Dramatic pause. ðŸ‘‰ Audience cue to gasp. 

I know. It's not dramatic and I shouldn't complain. I snapped my finger in half earlier this year and was AWOL for some three months. That was dramatic. This is pittance. 

But Iâ€™m itching to get back on the wall. 

The skin on my fingers has grown back in spades and my callouses are thicc. Spare time's been hard to come by what with starting a new gig and all. The last week has been a blur of meeting people, presentations, presenting, shipping (literally, first day production patch and deployment), sightseeing, and graciously sacrificing my diet in the name of a USA trip. 

All that to say, climbing has been on my mind but off my radar. 

The closest Iâ€™ve come is testing new climbing shoes in sport-stores that happenstance have been en route wherever I've been touristing.

This shouldn't be a priority, but I desparately need to replace my battered and bruised, circa 2019, entry level Scarpa's. Theyâ€™ve served me well â€” heck, theyâ€™ve held up well â€” but theyâ€™re well past their best-before date. And not just practically speaking. Theyâ€™ve recently become a manifest attack on my nostrils (ie, they f*cking reek), despite best efforts to the contrary. 

Having tried on many too many pairs of potential climbing shoes in the past week, I finally landed some that are hit the sweet spot on almost every dimension. That is: aggression, material, friction, volume, closure, sole. 

But here's the but. Theyâ€™re seeped â€” drenched â€” in an almost offensively garish Barbie shade of pink. Which, does it really matter? In the end, function over form and all... but then, they are really quite pink. And then I've just splashed out on a pink backpack. 

The men's version which is slightly wider is a palettable blue, but they just don't fit as well. 

A frustrated voice shouts from the back of the room: "shut the heck up about your first world problems and get the damn shoes". 

TouchÃ©. Still, they're a bit too pink.
