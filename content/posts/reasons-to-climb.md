Clickbait titles for fun, profit, and SEO supremecy. 

Anyway, reasons why I climb:

1. ~~To get abs~~
2. ~~To get a girlfriend~~
3. To momentarily liberate myself from the tedious pressures of the daily grind whilst quashing episodic day dreaming of cutting loose and starting a commune with comrades in the Peak District by hanging from colourful plastic rocks. Also gym dogs.
