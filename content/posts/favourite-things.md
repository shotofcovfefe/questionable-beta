I'm in a cafe trying hard to forget that I'm low on sleep. The covfefe helps. 

What was it again that brought me here, surely not the ever increasing queue of life-admin that'll no doubt combust in my face should I not crack on.

Great idea. But we can't do the same song, that would be even lamer than doing this in the first place.

And so it goes. Here's my lyrical retelling of an old classic, repurposed for climbing:

```
Chalk dust in my eyes and toes that are mangled,
Slipping from slopers before the top mantle.
Blisters and bruises, my forearm is cramping,
These are a few of my masochist things.

Crimps that are tiny and slabs that are slipp'ry,
Volumes that spin and routes that are tricky.
Beta so sketchy, the dynos they spook me,
I can't help but feel my sends are just flukey.

When the skin tears, when the pump hits,
When I’m feeling beat,
I simply remember my masochist things,
And get back to abusing my feet. 

...
```

There's obviously a lot more to the song... but I should really get on to that life admin (definitely not one of my _favourite things_).

Thanks for all the beta, until next time ✌️
