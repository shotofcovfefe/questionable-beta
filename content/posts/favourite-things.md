I'm in a cafe trying hard to forget that I'm low on sleep. The covfefe helps. 

What was it again that brought me here, surely not the ever increasing queue of life-admin that'll no doubt combust in my face should I not crack on.

Great idea! But we can't do the same song, that would be even lamer than doing this in the first place.

Sigh, I guess so. 

Here's my lyrical retelling of an old classic, repurposed to fit with the astute observation that climbers are really just masochists at heart:

```
Chalk dust in my eyes and toes that are mangled,
Slipping from slopers before the top mantle.
Blisters and bruises, my forearm is cramping,
These are a few of my masochist things.

Crimps that are tiny and slabs very greasy,
Volumes that spin, the footholds they tease me.
Beta so sketchy, the dynos they're spooky,
I can't help but feel my sends are just flukey.

Tape on my fingers, my shoes' stinky odor,
Faking I'm anything more than mediocre.
Tearing my tendons on pocketed swings,
These are a few of my masochist things.

When the skin tears, when the pump hits,
When I’m feeling beat,
I simply remember my masochist things,
And get back to abusing... myyy feet. 

...
```

There's more to the song... but I reeally should be getting back to that life admin stuff (unsurprisingly, not one of my _favourite things_).

Thanks for all the beta, until next time ✌️
