Are the dog days of summer over already? We're fast approaching summer solstice but here in London every day is overcast. Sunnier days have been and gone, and my internal monologue is slightly more pessimistic than usual. 

I know what you're thinking: if my mood is causally related to the weather, why don't I just pack up shop and hitch a ride down to the Amalfi Coast, buy a plot of arable farmland, and cultivate lemons and olive groves? Well, duh, because... Wait. Honestly not a terrible idea. 

\*sips imaginary Limoncello\* 

Focus! 👉 This is meant to be a blog about *bouldering*. 👈

Today marks the day that I found my body's climbing capacity; this old dyno bro has sprayed his last beta (well, until Sunday). 

I've climbed on and off for about five years now. But injuries, that whole covid thingy, and waves of apathy contibuted to stagnation. During periods of consistency I'd say I only really climbed once or twice a week. By yesterday, I was up to 5 gym sessions in the 6 days. 

That this was my limit was obvious as of around 5am this morning, when I woke in the night to my left arm painfully pulsing. No, not a heart attack. Just one too many mornings spent shamelessly and physcially abusing my body -- see: [Masochist]({{< ref "/posts/002-favourite-things" >}} "Masochists") -- , so that one day I can retreat into the jungle to live with the lemurs. 


Sometimes I have to remind myself that I'm little more than a fragile bag of meat and bone, and that meat bags like me have their limits.

Hot take. It's a net bad thing to be overly motivated. 

Motivation, much like a cookie in my line of sight, is fleeting. The trick is to recast those healthy behaviours as habits to where they're second nature, otherwise what could've been part of your lifestyle will just become a flash-in-the-pan period of your life that you'll have regrets over for not keeping up. 

It's honestly in the back of my head. That my current motivation spike towards climbing and "healthy living" generally won't transition into a routine part of long term existence. 

Time will tell, but in the end: worrying about it is fruitless, over-optimising for it is pointless. What counts is squeezing the most out of the lemons that life throws at you. 

... and turning them into Limoncello.
