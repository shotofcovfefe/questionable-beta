**Life becomes more meaningful when you appreciate how short it is.**

Napkin math. I’m 30 years old. Generously, I have 50 to go. Some 20 of which will bear relative immobility come retirement age. Of the remaining 30, a fifth will be devoted to work, another third to sleep. That leaves me with ~14 years of usable “me time” on my hands. **Yikes**. 

But it's not the time for existential dread. 

No. Now’s the time to celebrate the fact that I sent a soft v5/6 today. Which, for someone **slap bang in the middle of the v4 plateau** spurs hope of a rise, like the proverbial phoenix from the ashes, up to the lofty and idyllic heights of “flashing more v5s” that I’ve aspired towards ever since I tied my self-worth to climbing higher grades. 

Landing a new job is cool, and so is sharing it to LinkedIn to harvest fake internet karma. But will it ever compare to the feeling of sending a **sketchy foothold slab dyno with a mantle top out**? I'm only half joking.

If you’ve ever crushed a long-term project boulder and a group of people that you care for, smiling from ear to ear, encouraging you, fist-bumps at the ready, are waiting down on the crash pad in a sincere show of cheer, you’ll know what I mean. That’s a **rapturous, wholesome sensation**; “a real kick” as Kerouac might put it. 

If I’ve learnt anything in the past 6 months of self imposed exile from the workplace (read: unemployment), it’s that a full life — a fulfilling life — on one axis straddles the line between what’s routine and what’s novel, and the other how much quality time you spend with people who “**spark joy**”. 

**That’s why [climbing rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfHtlsbQsE)**. Yes for the novelty and problem solving required. Mostly, it’s a magnet for people who are genuine, warm, and supportive towards eachother. 

But ask yourself this, if you see someone send a route you're struggling with, does it hit more as inspiring or discouraging? 

If you tie the success of your climbing session to how many hard climbs you send, it'll lead to frustration. In spite of your own ego, other climbers aren’t nearly petty enough to confuse the highest grade you’ve ever climbed for how they should treat you. 

It's the same in the real world™. Barring those closest to you, **folks are generally apathetic towards your latest life milestone**. They’re so busy worrying about themselves that filling precious mental real estate with your successes flags a lacklustre tradeoff. You can and should enjoy the pat on the back while it lasts. But don’t expect it to sustain your mental wellbeing for more than a hot beat. 

**Happiness comes in waves**, but it correlates to the way in which you see the world in real time. Ultimately, you’ll be let down if you assume fulfilment comes from a new job, or breaking the v4 plateau and entering the v5 plateau. Meaning’s really not that hard to come by, you just need to **[look a little harder at what’s already around you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsYBtfQ3QDo)**. So go climb with people who spark joy, make merry and go gossip about the mundane already. 

**Life can be really quite fun if you will it to be**. And if you’re like me, you might only have 14 years left.
