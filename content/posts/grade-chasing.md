**Life becomes more meaningful when you appreciate how short it is.**

Napkin math. I‚Äôm 30 years old. Generously, I have 50 to go. Some 20 of which will bear relative immobility come retirement age. Of the remaining 30, a fifth will be devoted to work, another third to sleep. That leaves me with ~14 years of usable ‚Äúme time‚Äù on my hands. **Yikes**. 

But now's not the time for existential dread. 

No. Now‚Äôs the time to celebrate my sending a soft v5/6 today. Which, for someone **slap bang in the middle of the v4 plateau** spurs hope of a rise, like the proverbial phoenix from the ashes, up to the lofty heights of the next plateau that I‚Äôve aspired towards ever since I tied my self-worth to climbing higher grades. 

I landed a job recently, which is cool. Even cooler would be sharing it to social media to harvest fake internet karma. But, can it ever compare to the feeling of sending a **sketchy foothold slab dyno with a mantle top out**? 

I'm only half joking.

If you‚Äôve ever prevailed over a long-term project boulder in the company of friends, all smiling from ear to ear, encouraging you, fist-bumps at the ready, pounding on the crash pad in a sincere show of cheer, you‚Äôll know what I mean. That‚Äôs a **rapturous, wholesome sensation**; ‚Äúa real kick‚Äù as Kerouac might put it. 

If I‚Äôve learnt anything in the past 6 months of self imposed exile from the workplace (read: unemployment), it‚Äôs that a full life ‚Äî a fulfilling life ‚Äî on one axis straddles the line between what‚Äôs routine and what‚Äôs novel, and the other how much quality time you spend with people who ‚Äú**spark joy**‚Äù. 

**That‚Äôs why [climbing rocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYfHtlsbQsE)**. Yes for the novelty and puzzle solving. Mostly, it‚Äôs a magnet for good people, people who are _outwardly_ encouraging and supportive. _Inwardly_ there's more emotional variation. 

Ask yourself: if you see someone send a route you're struggling with, despite any outward reaction, does it hit more as inspiring or discouraging? To me, climbing has always been about good energy people celebrating eachothers wins. 

But if you tie the success of your climbing session to how many hard climbs you send, you'll just be frustrated. In spite of your own ego, other climbers aren‚Äôt nearly petty enough to conflate the highest grade you‚Äôve ever climbed for how they should treat you. 

It's the same in the Real World‚Ñ¢. Barring those closest to you, **folks are generally apathetic towards your latest life milestone**. They‚Äôre so busy worrying about themselves that filling precious mental real estate with your successes doesn't happen. You can and should enjoy the pat on the back while it lasts. Just don‚Äôt expect it to sustain your mental wellbeing for more than a hot beat. 

**Happiness comes in waves**, but it correlates to the way in which you see the world in real time. 

If you‚Äôre anything like me and only have 14 years of "me time" left, don't waste energy being frustrated over gratuitous persuits of status, wealth, or even climbing grades. No one on approaching their deathbed ever wished they worked harder. The common thread is **not taking life too seriously**. 

If you can do that, everything good will eventually follow, ~~maybe even a v7~~.
