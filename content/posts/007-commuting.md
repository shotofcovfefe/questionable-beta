The Central Line offends every fiber of my being. 

Of London's vast array of tube lines, it's at once: the [hottest](https://www.timeout.com/london/news/revealed-these-are-officially-londons-hottest-tube-lines-090123), most [polluted](https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/05/central-line-officially-dirtiest-tube-toxic-miasma-skin-dust-11044450), the [busiest](https://citymonitor.ai/transport/which-london-underground-line-busiest-3315), and the second [loudest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62449774). It's a sultry experience begrudgingly shared by a sultry crowd. Too often have I found myself trapped between a swell of people and the grimy metal skin of a downturned train door, inhaling a toxic stew of dead cells and dirt. It also happens to be my new daily commute[^1]. 


<!-- In a stange way, it's life affirming -->

The Central Line is utterly loathsome. But it's far from the only place in London. 

Case in point.

Some time ago, a troll posting on an internet forum blithely suggested, alongisde a list of *real* touristy things, that walking the length of the Rotherhithe Tunnel was "an absolute must" for anyone visiting London. I've long since favoured scouting out 'off the beaten track' 'hidden gems' over their more well trodden counterparts ([Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/), ilysfm), and as fate would have it the Rotherhithe tunnel was right on my doorstep. Boom.

Gleefully, I floated the idea to a friend who turned out to be just as gullible as me. Double boom.

We packed our bags and descended naively into the dank, tubular cavern below the Thames. It was everything we thought it would be... that is, if we had given the odyssey in question any thought whatsoever.

It's perhaps the only time I've known the taste of real, actual, intense pollution. The merry family of Central Line pollutants on high dose steroids. I vividly recall an itchy throat, the metallic stench of petrol and diesel, and a thin, greasy lining of soot forming on the surface of my face. 

We almost immediately realised this was one of those dumb ideas that shouldn't have made it past the drawing board. But, due to some combination of embarrassment to suggest quitting and stubborn male bravado, we persisted. Adventure -- amongst other more sinister things -- was in the air.

By the time we decided to turn back, a sign indicated we'd hit 741 meters, or: halfway. Onwards we went and through the otherside to freedom. Despite the venture surely bringing any natural death forward by some number of days, it was a hilarious lesson in not believing everything you read online. 

You're probably wondering, how does this relate to climbing? Is all this some overdrawn prelude prior to preaching about the adverse health impact of chalk particulate matter endemic to indoor climbing gyms? Actually, no. At least, not yet.

This storied quest through the tunnel happens to be the same day I went bouldering for the first time in my life. 

(Though, apparently not my first time _climbing_ as this picture evidences. Just look at 12 year old me absolutely rocking some classic Converse. To think I just bought [new climbing shoes]({{< ref "/posts/006-climbing-shoes/" >}}) when I could've pulled these from the top drawer).

Not so far from the other side of said tunnel is the Arch Climbing Wall in Bermondsey, which in a past life played residence to the art of one Damien Hirst. A great space. A little hot during summer days and a little cool in winter. But nonetheless.

Of the folks who went that day, flatmates and comrades alike, I'm the only one that's stuck with it enough to  [crush v7s at will]({{< ref "/posts/005-lucky-number-seven" >}})[^2]. Or rather, I remember my utter glee bouncing up and down the wall. I remember the awe of seeing strong climbers ascend impossible routes. I remember the sense of community, the positive energy folks wielded. 

It was the bees knees, and I wanted in.

Now that's out the way, here's the educational part.[^3] [^4] [^5] [^6] [^7]

{{< dialogue text="Just how polluted _is_ the Undergound?<nl>It depends! Old, deep tube lines like the Central, Northern, and Victoria lines are the worst offenders.<nl>Right. How bad are they really?<nl>Pollution takes many forms. One is PM2.5 (a _super tiny_ Particulate Matter that penetrates deep in the lungs). Some parts of the Underground expose you to 20x \"typical\" roadside air. It's estimated >9000 Londoners die prematurely as a result.<nl>That's awful. Good thing I only hang out in climbing gyms.<nl>Not so fast. A study from 2012 showed that climbing gyms PM2.5 concentration can be even worse! Long term effects are unclear as climbing gyms only started popping up in the late 1980's, but exposure can cause lung irritation and pulmonary problems.<nl>Do you think climbing gyms are more badly polluted than the underground then?!<nl>No! Pollution is a loaded term and there different particulates have different effects. Particulate matters (PMx), VOCs, metalic particles, NO2, CO2, etc. Parts of the underground are almost certainly more damaging to you than in the long run than climbing gyms.<nl>Still scary though, should I stop climbing forever?!<nl>Of course not! Just make sure to climb in modern gyms with powerful filtering systems, consider using liquid chalk, or do what the author of this blog isn't cool enough to and go climb outdoors instead.<nl>Thanks little bee üêù<nl>Thank you Monsieur üê¢" >}}
